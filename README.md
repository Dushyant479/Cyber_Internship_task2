# Task 2 README — Phishing-Email Analysis

## What We Did
1. **Collected Samples**  
   – Visited a public phishing-education page hosted by a well-known security-awareness company (Hook Security).  
   – Reviewed the gallery of real-world phishing messages and selected four representative emails covering different lures:  
     • fake document share (Google Drive)  
     • account verification (GitHub)  
     • password-change alert (Microsoft)  
     • high-severity security alert (Office 365)

2. **Captured Evidence**  
   – Took full screenshots of each chosen email and saved them in the repository folder `screenshots/` (`email1.png … email4.png`).

3. **Analyzed Phishing Indicators**  
   – Examined sender domains, branding, language, calls-to-action, and link prompts.  
   – Documented every red flag in `phishing_analysis.md`, including a comparison table that maps each indicator to the four samples.

4. **Prepared Deliverables**  
   – Repository now contains:  
     • `phishing_analysis.md` – detailed findings.  
     • `screenshots/` – four image files.  
     • This `README.md` – overview of process and contents.

## Key Takeaways
- Spoofed or look-alike domains, urgent language, and generic greetings remain the most consistent phishing hallmarks.  
- Visual inspection (screenshots) combined with structured analysis (markdown table) clearly highlights why each email is unsafe.
